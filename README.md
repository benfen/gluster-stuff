# gluster-stuff

This project uses vagrant to set up a trio of vms to run a gluster fs cluster.  Most of the configuration for the server is borrowed from the [gluster quickstart guide](https://docs.gluster.org/en/latest/Quick-Start-Guide/Quickstart/).

## Requirements

* Vagrant (tested at 2.2.3)
* Ansible (tested at 2.2.1)
* Provider for vagrant (tested with Virtualbox 6.0)
